      <p>
        Christopher Columbus was an Italian explorer and navigator who completed
        four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean, opening the way for the
        widespread European exploration and colonization of the Americas. His
        expeditions, sponsored by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, were the first
        European contact with the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.
